We are now working with a 2D convolutional layer, so there is no need to start with a Flatten layer because the dimensions of the input image already match the required dimension of the first layer. We tell the layer that the input image has 3 channels and we want the layer to output 64 channels. We also state that we want a kernel size of 5×5, a stride of 2x2. Finally, we state that we want to pad the image with 2 pixels on each side, which in combination with the 5x5 kernel size and 2x2 stride will result in the output resolution being half of the resolution of the input image. That is, the output of the layer will be 16x16 neurons per channel. We specify the neuron type as ReLU because that has been shown to be a good activation function.\n",
