To enable us to easily one-hot encode each character, we want to assign a monotonically increasing index to each character. This is done by first creating a list of unique characters. Once we have that list, we can loop over it and assign an incrementing index to each character. We do this twice to create one dictionary (a hash table) that maps from character to index and a reverse dictionary from index to character. These will come in handy later when we want to convert text into one-hot encoded input to the network as well as when we want to convert one-hot encoded output into characters. Finally, we initialize a variable encoding_width with the count of unique characters, which will be the width of each one-hot encoded vector that represents a character."

From the perspective of training our model, it will look similar to the book sales prediction example, but we use a deeper model consisting of two LSTM layers. Both LSTM layers use a dropout value of 0.2 on the connections between layers as well as on the recurrent connections. Note how we pass return_sequences=True to the constructor of the first layer because the second layer needs to see the output values for all timesteps from the first layer. The second LSTM layer is followed by a fully connected layer with multiple neurons using a softmax function because we will be predicting probabilities for discrete entities (characters). We use categorical cross-entropy as our loss function, which is the recommended loss function for multicategory classification.\n",

We will also inspect the predictions to get an idea of whether the network is doing what we would like it to do. Finally, we train the model for 32 epochs with a mini-batch size of 256.\n"

In our implementation, each beam is represented by a tuple with three elements. The first element is the logarithm of the cumulative probability for the current sequence of characters (logarithm is used to avoid numerical underflow, see book for more details). The second element is the string of characters. The third element is a one-hot encoded version of the string of characters.\n",

The probability for each beam can be computed by multiplying the current probability of the beam by the probability for the added word.\n",
